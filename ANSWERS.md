 Compatibility Issues
	Version Conflicts: New versions of software or extensions may not be compatible with existing installations or other extensions.
 Dependency Management
	Missing Dependencies: Some software or extensions require additional libraries or dependencies that need to be installed separately.
	Conflicting Dependencies: Different versions of libraries may conflict with each other, causing errors or unexpected behaviour.
 Configuration Challenges
	Complex Configuration: Configuring software and extensions to work correctly can be complex, requiring specific settings or configurations.
	Security Settings: Ensuring secure configurations (especially for databases like MySQL) can be challenging and is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities.
 Resource Requirements
	System Resources: Some software, particularly integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio, can be resource-intensive and may slow down older or less powerful machines.
	Storage Space: Large installations can consume significant disk space.
 Installation Errors
	Installation Failures: Errors during the installation process can occur due to corrupted downloads, interrupted installations, or insufficient permissions.
	Incomplete Installations: Sometimes installations do not complete properly, leaving the software in an unusable state.
 Network Issues
	Download Problems: Slow or unreliable internet connections can cause downloads to fail or become corrupted.
	Firewall/Proxy Issues: Network firewalls or proxy settings can block downloads or the installation of certain software.
 Extension/Plugin Management
	Finding the Right Extensions: With a large number of available extensions, it can be challenging to find the ones that best meet your needs.
	Extension Conflicts: Extensions or plugins may conflict with each other, causing instability or crashes.
 Version Control and Updates
	Keeping Software Updated: Regular updates are necessary for security and functionality, but keeping track of updates for multiple pieces of software can be cumbersome.
	Backward Compatibility: Updates may introduce changes that are not backward compatible, potentially breaking existing projects.
 User Permissions and Administrative Rights
	Administrative Rights: Some installations require administrative privileges, which may not be available to all users, particularly in managed corporate environments.
	User Permissions: Proper permissions must be set to allow the software to run correctly and access necessary resources
